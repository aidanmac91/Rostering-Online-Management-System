<h3>Aidan McCarthy</h3>

<p>ROMS is a Rostering Online Management System that is developed for a medical organisation. <br>
	The organisation operates multiple residential locations and each location has a number of different employees, i.e. Nursing staff, Care staff.<br>
	  ROMS will allow employees to access their data; check their work schedule, request changes to their schedule and to check medical requirements of their clients.  
	</p>

<p>Built in PHP, HTML, CSSJavaScript, ROMS is a web application that will access a NoSQL database specifically MongoDB. 
	<br>Unlike traditional table-based databases like MySQL, MongoDB uses a document-oriented style of database management, which allows for easier scalability, 
	<br>which means faster and easier integration of data.
